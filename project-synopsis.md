# Smart Construction Management System with Facial Recognition

## 1. Introduction

The construction industry faces significant challenges in managing workforce attendance, machinery usage, and material tracking. Traditional methods often rely on manual processes, which are time-consuming, prone to errors, and inefficient. This project aims to develop a comprehensive construction management system that leverages facial recognition technology for accurate attendance tracking while providing robust features for project management, machinery tracking, and material management.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current construction management systems suffer from several limitations:
- Manual attendance tracking is prone to proxy attendance and errors
- Difficulty in tracking machinery usage and maintenance
- Inefficient material management and cost tracking
- Lack of real-time project status monitoring
- Complex worker payment and advance management
- Limited visibility into project progress and resource utilization

## 3. Objectives

1. To develop a facial recognition-based attendance system for construction workers
2. To implement a comprehensive project management system with real-time status tracking
3. To create an efficient machinery usage tracking system with cost calculation
4. To develop a material management system with cost tracking
5. To implement a worker payment and advance management system
6. To create a secure and scalable database architecture
7. To develop user-friendly interfaces for different user roles

## 4. Proposed Solution

### System Architecture
The system will be built using a modern tech stack:
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
